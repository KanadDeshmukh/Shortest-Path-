# Hospital Locator: A Shortest Path Simulator for Pusad

Hello all! During my final year, I chose to study how Google Maps works and selected it as my project to find the shortest path in road networks. Although I failed to create a simulator back then, I gained a solid understanding of the algorithm. Now, after two years of working experience, I'm excited to present a small simulator for hospitals in my town.
